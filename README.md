# morellonomicon

Alexa, open Morellonomicon
Makes sense; opening up a book to look up stuff

Alexa, open Vel'koz
Vel'koz is known to want to know everything
but it is slightly confusing when asking about Vel'koz himself

How fast is it to query Alexa and get response if...
querying the api and parsing data?
querying but have a cache for previous data?
querying without usage of framework?

tell Morellonomicon what is Tryndamere Q cooldown at rank 5 with 10% cooldown
tell Morellonomicon what is Tryndamere E cooldown 
tell Morellonomicon what is Tryndamere R cooldown at 20%


Make Alexa ask for a champion first or complex right off the bat



`pip install flask`
