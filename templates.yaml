welcome : Welcome to Champion Cooldown. Which champion would you like information on?
help: |
    I can help you find information on ability cooldowns for champions in League of Legends.
    You can ask a phrase like 'Bard rank three ultimate at forty percent CDR'. Another example is,
    Evelynn Q ability at rank three with ten percent cooldown.
    I can also walk you through the process. Start by saying a champion name.
